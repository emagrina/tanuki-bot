# TanukiBot

An AI agent that generates full project structures via self-feedback, without writing code.

## Overview

TanukiBot is a Python-based AI agent designed to autonomously generate and evolve complete project structures.  
Instead of producing raw code line by line, it operates at a higher abstraction level: planning, structuring, validating, and iterating through internal feedback loops.

It is built as a CLI-driven system with task tracking and execution, suitable for bootstrapping repositories and early-stage project architecture.
